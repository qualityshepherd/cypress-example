# Cypress Example

An example project using the automation tool, [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). These tests are quite silly but are intended to provide examples of common actions you may need in your testing. I've included:
- page objects
- various ways of running the tests (via npm scripts)

## Rant
Cypress is an _agressively_ opinionated framework... some of these opinions are at best, misguided :) YMMV. I know it's very popular... but honestly, **I would avoid Cypress if you can**. My issues with Cypress include:

1. it hates on page objects
1. it has a versioning problem: TONS of misinformation about how to use it on the internets
1. it cannot handle new windows/tabs
1. it can't handle multiple domains in one test file
1. it requires learning a proprietary framework rather than learning to code
1. it teaches some bad testing habits (eg. expects in page objects)
1. it thinks conditionals in tests are ok; they're not
1. it's slow
1. anything it doesn't handle the docs will tell you _YOU SHOULDN'T WANT TO DO THAT_ (eg. test if an element exists)
1. I have yet to see _anyone_ use it well

I _strongly_ suggest using [Testcafe](https://github.com/qualityshepherd/testcafe-example) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) instead.
